# Data-Science-Specialization (Coursera)

This repo contains my solution to the Coursera specialization "[Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)". In this Specialization, we will explore the concepts and tools we'll need throughout the entire data science pipeline, from asking the right kinds of questions to making inferences and publishing results. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply the skills learned by building a data product using real-world data. At completion, students will have a portfolio demonstrating their mastery of the material.

This specialization consists of ten courses:

- [The Data Scientist’s Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools)
- [R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming)
- [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning)
- [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis)
- [Reproducible Research](https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research)
- [Statistical Inference](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inference)
- [Regression Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-models)
- [Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning)
- [Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products)
- [Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project)
